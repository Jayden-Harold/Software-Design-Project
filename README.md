## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Before getting started with our website

### System administrator 

To explore the website as a system administrator, you will need to log in to the following 
Google account: 
- Aquilina Oosthuizen
- aquilinaoosthuizen@gmail.com
- Password: aquilinaoosthuizen1234

### Residents and Staff Members

To explore the website functionality as a resident or staff member, you may either make a new account or log in to one of the following google accounts
1. Resident: glorianaidu@gmail.com password:
2. Staff: lorienne maramba password

Should you wish to create a new account, you will need to log in as a system administrator after registering to approve the account before you can make use of the website functionality. A single Google account cannot have more than one role within the website, so, should you wish to explore both staff and resident functionality, you will need to register a new account using a different email address or log in to one of the accounts above. These accounts have already been onboarded and do not require approval from the system administrator. 

Google OAuth is used as a third-party identity provider.
