## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Before getting started with our website

### System administrator 

To explore the website as a system administrator, you will need to log in to the following 
Google account: 
- Aquilina Oosthuizen
- aquilinaoosthuizen@gmail.com
- Password: aquilinaoosthuizen1234

### Residents and Staff Members

To explore the website functionality as a resident or staff member, you may either make a new account or log in to one of the following Google accounts:<br>
1. Resident:   
   1. Gloria Naidu  
   2. [gloria.s.naidu@gmail.com](mailto:glorianaidu@gmail.com)   
   3. Password: glorianaidu5678
2. Staff:   
   1. Lorienne Maramba   
   2. [loriennemaramba@gmail.com](mailto:loriennemaramba@gmail.com)  
   3. Password: loriennemaramba9123

Should you wish to create a new account, you will need to log in as a system administrator after registering to approve the account before you can make use of the website functionality. A single Google account cannot have more than one role within the website, so, should you wish to explore both staff and resident functionality, you will need to register a new account using a different email address or log in to one of the accounts above. These accounts have already been onboarded and do not require approval from the system administrator. 

**Google OAuth is used as a third-party identity provider.**
